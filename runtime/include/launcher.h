/**
 * launcher.h — ROM discovery, identity verification, and external-ROM loading.
 *
 * Identity verification has two layers. CRC validation is driven by
 * game_extras hooks (game_get_expected_crc32 / game_get_valid_crcs),
 * mirroring the NES recomp pattern; game projects provide an extras.c
 * implementing those, and they take precedence (multi-revision carts).
 * When no CRC hooks are declared, the launcher falls back to an exact
 * SHA-256 match against the digest the recompiler embedded at gen time
 * (see launcher_set_expected_sha256). Both layers absent → no validation.

 * declares CRC hooks (game_get_valid_crcs / game_get_expected_crc32), which
