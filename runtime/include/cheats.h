/**
 * @file cheats.h
 * @brief Libretro-style .cht cheat loader + applier.
 *
 * Reads the game's .cht files from cheats/ on cart launch and exposes
 * the parsed entries to the UI. Two code types are supported:
 *
 *   - GameShark "01VVLLHH"  -> write byte $VV to RAM $HHLL each frame.
 *     Applied by gb_cheats_tick() from the runtime's per-frame poll.
 *
 *   - Game Genie "XXX-XXX-XXX" / "XXX-XXX"  -> ROM patch with
 *     optional compare-byte verifier. Applied at toggle-on, the
 *     original byte saved to a per-op backup for toggle-off
 *     restore. Bank-0 addresses ($0000-$3FFF) are fully supported;
 *     banked addresses ($4000-$7FFF) are best-effort -- v1 patches
 *     the bank-0 mirror only and logs a note for the user.
 *
 * Cheats are cart-agnostic: anything in the libretro database can
 * drop in. The module makes no assumptions about Pokemon-specific
 * data.
