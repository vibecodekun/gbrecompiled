/*
 * gb_host_paths.h — where a packaged build keeps its files.
 *
 * Every packaged form of a recompiled game has to answer two different
 * questions, and conflating them is what breaks AppImages and .app bundles:
 *
 *   STATE  — writable, user-visible, must survive an update of the program:
 *            rom.cfg, keybinds.ini, runtime_prefs.ini, *.sav, *.rtc, *.stateN.
 *   ASSETS — read-only payload shipped WITH the program: launcher assets/,
 *            BPS enhancement patches, any other bundled data file.
 *
 * On Windows (a zip extracted to a folder) the two are the same directory and
 * nothing changes. They diverge exactly where the program lives inside a
 * read-only container:
 *
 *   Linux AppImage : assets are inside the squashfs mount, under its usr/bin,
 *                    state must land next to the .AppImage file itself.
 *   macOS .app     : assets are inside Foo.app/Contents/..., state belongs in
 *                    the folder the user actually sees the .app sitting in.
 *
 * Both accessors return a directory WITH a trailing separator, or an empty
 * string meaning "use the process working directory" (the historical
 * behaviour, and the last-resort fallback if the platform query fails).
 *
 * Resolution order for the state directory:
 *   1. $GBRECOMP_STATE_DIR   — explicit override (packaging tests, CI, kiosk
 *                              installs that want state elsewhere).
 *   2. $APPIMAGE             — set by the AppImage runtime to the path of the
 *                              .AppImage file; its directory is the anchor.
 *   3. the .app's container  — when the executable sits in *.app/Contents/MacOS.
 *   4. the executable's own directory.
 *   5. "" (process working directory).
 *
 * Resolution order for the asset directory:
 *   1. $GBRECOMP_ASSET_DIR   — explicit override.
 *   2. the executable's own directory.
 *   3. "" (process working directory).
