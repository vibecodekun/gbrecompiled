# GB Recompiled — Development Fork

A **static recompiler** for original Game Boy ROMs that translates SM83 assembly into portable C code. Run classic Game Boy games as native executables — no traditional emulator required.

> ### ⚠ This is a development fork. The canonical project is [arcanite24/gb-recompiled](https://github.com/arcanite24/gb-recompiled) — go there for stable use.
>
> This repository (`mstan/gbrecompiled`) is a **personal development fork** by [@mstan](https://github.com/mstan), built on two upstreams: the original recompiler by [arcanite24](https://github.com/arcanite24) and the runtime/hardware work from the [GB-Recomp/gb-recompiled](https://github.com/GB-Recomp/gb-recompiled) fork (merged 2026-06), plus mstan's PPU fixes, TCP debug server, launcher hooks, and game-specific work (Megaman Xtreme 2, Pokemon Red/Blue). It may diverge from either upstream at any time.

This fork inherits the GB-Recomp feature set — see [Fork Additions](#fork-additions) below — and adds the runtime changes documented under [What This Fork Adds](#what-this-fork-adds).

## Fork Additions

Everything below is built on top of upstream `arcanite24/gb-recompiled`. Most are runtime / launcher features that any recompiled cart picks up automatically by linking against this fork's `gbrt`.

### Networking & link play
- **BGB-compatible link cable over TCP** — peer-to-peer between two recompiled instances; verified Pokemon trade between Gen 1 carts.
- **LAN peer auto-discovery** — Esc menu's Network section finds other instances on the same LAN.
- **Internet relay** — companion `gb-link-rendezvous` Flask server + `relay_client.c` for NAT-traversal-style introductions. Gameplay still runs P2P over BGB once paired.

### Pokemon Gen 2 Mystery Gift mock
- Scripted Mystery Gift for Pokemon Gold / Silver / Crystal — pick an item or decoration from an Esc-menu carousel, the next in-game IR exchange delivers it. Uses a runtime `gb_dispatch` override that intercepts each cart's `ExchangeMysteryGiftData` entry point and synthesizes a successful exchange.
- Cart-side flow runs unmodified afterward: items go to the Goldenrod counter, decorations into your bedroom PC list (after save + Continue).

### Hardware emulation
- **Super Game Boy** support — palettes, cart-supplied border, MASK_EN. Auto-enables from cart header; can be toggled mid-game.
- **Game Boy Camera** (MBC `$FC`) — exposes a host webcam to the cart via per-platform native APIs (Linux v4l2, macOS AVFoundation, Windows Media Foundation; zero runtime deps). Opt-in via CMake `-DGBRT_ENABLE_GBCAM=ON` (default off) so non-Camera carts don't compile or link it.
- **Game Boy Printer** — virtual paper printer that writes received prints to `<cwd>/prints/*.png`, with smart concatenation across multi-page jobs.
- **GBC IR port (`$FF56`)** — generic state machine for the CGB IR LED + photodiode; used by the Mystery Gift mock above.

### Display pipeline
- **GLES 2.0 rendering backend** with a built-in post-process shader pipeline. One binary covers desktop Mesa, Mali, Adreno — same shaders run everywhere.
- **Shipped shader presets** (sharp / scanlines / CRT-like effects) selectable from the Esc menu's Look section. Per-game shader preference stays sticky once set.
- **RetroArch `.slangp` presets through [librashader](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader)** (`runtime/src/librashader_chain.cpp`), opened at run time: put a `librashader.dll` / `.so` built with `--no-default-features --features runtime-opengl` and a `shaders/` folder of presets beside the binary. Picker with filter, live parameters, bezel mode, and a preset editor (the picked preset's passes changed, reordered or added to, whole presets chained, and saved as presets of your own, which can be deleted again, to the Recycle Bin on Windows; `runtime/src/slang_preset.cpp`). Needs GLES 3.0+ (ANGLE gives 3.1 when asked). On Windows a new preset is first compiled in a hidden child process, because Microsoft's HLSL optimizer under ANGLE overflows its stack on a few presets; such a preset is retried, and then run, with the optimizer off (ANGLE's `D3DCompile` is routed through the runtime for that). Compiled programs persist in `shader_cache/` (`runtime/src/gl_program_cache.cpp`). librashader's GLSL ES output needs a few patches to work under ANGLE; the Shantae repo carries them.

### Experimental custom game views

`runtime/include/gb_custom_view.h` provides an opt-in host compositor independent
of the hardware PPU buffer and save-state format. A game installs its renderer,
scanline-zero snapshot, save-load reset, and optional read taps in `game_on_init`.
The SDL presenter resolves Fit from the actual window aspect, with a 160–4096
pixel width at 144 pixels high; unsupported scenes get centered native output.
Legacy widescreen remains available to games that do not install this compositor.

The paired Mega Man Xtreme 2 experiment exposes adaptive widescreen through
the launcher's Mods checkbox and renders at the original game cadence.

For isolated test instances, `GBRECOMP_DEBUG_PORT` chooses a TCP debug port
(1–65535) when no explicit port was supplied. The default remains 4370.

### Per-game UX
- **Per-game preferences** — palette, shader, SGB toggles, custom border, hardware mode (DMG/SGB/CGB/AUTO). Globals act as defaults; overrides save per game ID.
- **Custom SGB borders** — drop 256x224 PNGs into `borders/` next to the binary; cycle from the Esc menu.
- **Cart-border cache** — SGB border decoded once and cached to disk so non-SGB modes can still display it.
- **Pocket / Light palette presets**, **Show FPS overlay**, **audio settings**, **input remapping** with controller support and per-profile labels (Xbox / PlayStation / Nintendo / Generic).
- **Savestates** with multi-slot UI.
- **Cheats** — libretro-database `.cht` files (GameShark RAM writes each frame, Game Genie ROM patches) in `cheats/` beside the game's other state: a build of one game reads every `.cht` there and in `cheats/<save id>/`; a build that loads games reads `cheats/<game id>/` and the `.cht` files named after that id. **Reload Cheats** reads them again without a restart (`runtime/src/cheats.c`).

### Launcher infrastructure
- **Multi-ROM launcher** with a graphical picker, missing-ROM tagging, and `--game <id>` headless launch.
- **Single-cart auto-start** — when a launcher has exactly one game registered, the picker is skipped and the cart boots straight up.
- **Restart Game, Return to Launcher, Quit** — in the Esc menu's System section (press twice) and the settings window's footer (with a confirmation). Restart Game puts the machine back as it was before its first frame, in place, keeping the cart's battery RAM (`gb_before_first_frame` keeps that state). Return to Launcher hands exit code 64 to a launcher that started the game; in a build whose recomp-ui launcher runs before the game, the program starts again with `GBRECOMP_LAUNCHER=1` once this one has saved and closed.
- **Menus hold the game** — while the Esc menu or the settings window is open the game waits, silent (Pause in Menu, `ui.pause_in_menu`), and gets no keys or buttons; shortcuts do not fire, including while typing into a filter field. Game Dimming and Menu Opacity (`ui.menu_dim`, `ui.menu_opacity`) set how much the menus cover the game.
- **`--prefix-symbols`** flag on `gbrecomp` so multiple carts can be linked into one binary without symbol collisions.
- **Native asset-loader integration** — ROM data is bundled into the binary as compressed sections that get extracted into `assets/<id>/` on first boot.
- **`roms/` subfolder convention** — user-supplied ROMs live at `roms/<id>.<ext>` next to the binary.

### Recompiler workflow
- **Directory mode** with auto-discovery of per-ROM `.sym` / `.annotations` files.
- **Parallel code generation**, **annotation handling** (skips non-address sym lines), and various analyzer fixes.

### Ecosystem
- [GB-Recomp/pgbcomp](https://github.com/GB-Recomp/pgbcomp) — Pokemon Gen 1 + Gen 2 compilation umbrella that FetchContents six per-game repos plus this fork.
- Per-game repos under [github.com/GB-Recomp](https://github.com/GB-Recomp): `pokered`, `pokeblue`, `pokeyellow`, `pokegold`, `pokesilver`, `pokecrystal` — each builds standalone or links into a compilation.

## What This Fork Adds

Changes from upstream focused on runtime correctness and performance:

### PPU (Graphics)
- VRAM/OAM write protection during rendering modes
- SCX/SCY per-scanline latching for correct scroll effects
- LCD on/off transition state reset
- Variable mode 3 timing based on sprite count and fine scroll
- Window WY trigger correctness (exact LY==WY match)
- Tile-batched background rendering (~16x fewer VRAM reads per scanline)
- Optimized sprite rendering with direct VRAM access

### Performance
- `gb_tick` hot path: TIMA fast-path with XOR edge detection, inlined cycle counting, branch prediction hints
- Channel 4 noise LFSR iteration cap
- Removed per-frame debug overhead from RGB framebuffer conversion

### Audio
- Smooth underrun fade-out (holds last sample instead of inserting silence pops)

### Configuration
- Multi-CRC ROM validation (`valid_crcs` in TOML) for supporting multiple ROM versions
- Configurable `output_prefix` for generated file naming
- SRAM save debouncing (5-second cooldown after last write)

---

## Features (from upstream)

- **High Compatibility**: Successfully recompiles **98.9%** of the tested ROM library (1592/1609 ROMs). Recompilation success does not guarantee full playability.
- **Native Performance**: Generated C code compiles to native machine code
- **Runtime Library**: Cycle-aware instruction emulation, scanline PPU, 4-channel APU, MBC1/2/3/5 support
- **SDL2 Platform Layer**: Keyboard/controller input, audio, window display
- **Debugging Tools**: Trace logging, interpreter fallback logging, TCP debug server
- **Cross-Platform**: macOS, Linux, and Windows (via CMake + Ninja)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **CMake** 3.15+
- **Ninja** build system
- **SDL2** development libraries
- A C/C++ compiler (Clang, GCC, or MSVC)

### Building the Recompiler

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mstan/gbrecompiled.git
cd gbrecompiled
cmake -G Ninja -B build .
ninja -C build
```

### Recompiling a ROM

```bash
# Generate C code from a ROM
./build/bin/gbrecomp path/to/game.gb -o output/game

# Build the generated project
cmake -G Ninja -S output/game -B output/game/build
ninja -C output/game/build

# Run
./output/game/build/game
```

### Using a TOML Config (Recommended for complex games)

For games like Pokemon that need manually specified entry points:

```bash
./build/bin/gbrecomp --config game_config.toml
```

See [PokemonRedAndBlueRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/PokemonRedAndBlueRecomp) for a complete example of a TOML-configured game project.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Analysis Phase

The recompiler performs static control flow analysis:
- Discovers reachable code from entry points (`0x100`, interrupt vectors, TOML config)
- Tracks bank switches to follow cross-bank calls and jumps
- Detects computed jumps (`JP HL`) and resolves jump tables
- Separates code from data using heuristics

### 2. Code Generation

Instructions are translated to C:
```c
// Original: LD A, [HL+]
ctx->a = gb_read8(ctx, ctx->hl++);

// Original: JP NZ, 0x1234
if (!ctx->flag_z) { func_00_1234(ctx); return; }
```

Each ROM bank becomes a separate C file. Code paths not discovered during analysis fall back to an interpreter at runtime.

### 3. Runtime

The generated code links against `libgbrt`, which provides:
- Memory-mapped I/O
- PPU scanline rendering with per-scanline scroll latching
- Audio sample generation (4 channels, 44.1kHz)
- Timer, interrupt, and DMA handling
- ROM file picker with CRC32 validation
- SRAM battery save persistence

## Debugging

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--trace` | Print every instruction during analysis |
| `--limit <N>` | Stop analysis after N instructions |
| `--add-entry-point b:addr` | Manually add entry point (e.g., `1:4000`) |
| `--no-scan` | Disable aggressive code scanning |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed analysis statistics |
| `--use-trace <file>` | Seed analyzer with runtime trace |

At runtime, interpreter fallbacks are logged to `interp_fallbacks.log` with bank and address. Add these addresses to your TOML config to eliminate fallbacks in the next build.

A TCP debug server listens on `localhost:4370` for runtime inspection and control:
register state, memory, the always-on frame ring, watchpoints, frame stepping,
save/load state, transient input injection and screenshots of the presented
frame. Every command is documented in **[docs/DEBUG_SERVER.md](docs/DEBUG_SERVER.md)**.

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| SUCCESS | 1592 | 98.94% |
| RECOMPILE_FAIL | 1 | 0.06% |
| RUN_TIMEOUT | 1 | 0.06% |
| EXCEPTION | 7 | 0.44% |

> **Note:** Recompilation success means the ROM was successfully translated to C. It does not guarantee the game is fully playable — runtime correctness depends on entry point coverage and runtime accuracy.

### Exhaustive MBC5 ROM entries

A game config can set `[options] exhaustive_rom = true` for a 2-256-bank MBC5
image. This emits a native instruction entry for every ROM byte in both fixed
and switchable mappings (including bank zero), plus HALT-bug fetch variants.
The analyzed functions remain the fast path. Unanalyzed ROM entries use static
address maps and operand-specialized native C functions; cross-window operands
are read live. Every-byte `.asm` listings include data and overlapping candidates,
so this is executable coverage rather than a semantic code/data classification.
The `<prefix>_exhaustive.json` report records the ROM fingerprint and entry counts.
Unknown executable RAM and illegal opcodes terminate with a diagnostic instead
of using the interpreter. Generic RAM opcode helpers are disabled in this mode;
games must provide compiled overlays or location-specific native RAM translations
through `game_dispatch_override`. Explicit interpreter/differential modes remain available. `scan_banks` continues
to control only the ordinary function-discovery pass.
